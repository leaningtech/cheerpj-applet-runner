# CheerpJ Applet Runner (Beta)

<p align="center"><img src="media/cheerpj_logo_whitebg.png" width="300"></p>

The CheerpJ Applet Runner is a Chrome Extension that enables Java applets without requiring a local Java installation or to install deprecated plugins. This extension is available at <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cheerpj-applet-runner/bbmolahhldcbngedljfadjlognfaaein>.
 
Since Java Applets have lost support on the majority of browsers, a tremendous amount of content, particularly in science and education, is virtually inaccessible. We aim at solving this problem by providing a solution to extend the life of Java applets on modern browsers.

What is the CheerpJ Applet Runner Extension?
-------
<p align="center"><img src="media/cheerpj_applet_demo1.gif" width="400"></p>

The CheerpJ Applet Runner Extension works by converting the Java Applet on the fly through CheerpJ.js, a minimal Java-bytecode-to-JavaScript compiler, directly on the browser, and linking it to the CheerpJ runtime environment.

Please note that the first activation of the CheerpJ Applet Runner extension on an applet will lead to a one-time download of approximately 20Mb. Subsequent uses will only download the applet content.
