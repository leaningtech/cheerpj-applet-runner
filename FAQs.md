# CheerpJ Applet Runner (Beta) FAQs

## How does CheerpJ work?

The CheerpJ Applet Enabler Extension works by converting the Java Applet on the fly through CheerpJ.js, a minimal Java-bytecode-to-JavaScript compiler, and linking it to the CheerpJ runtime environment.

The compiler runs directly on your browser and doesn't transmit your applet or the URL you are visiting to any external server.

The CheerpJ Applet Runner is not a plugin, and therefore does not pose any security threat, unlike Java applets.

## Is any information sent to the cloud by the CheerpJ Applet Runner?

No, 100% of code execution is happening locally on the JavaScript engine of your browser. We do not collect information on the web pages
you are visiting, or any logs from the extension. We use Google Analytics to track the use of the extension itself, but not of the web pages and applets that you are exploring.
You can opt out from tracking entirely from the extension Settings.

## Can I report applets that are not working?

We encourage everybody to file a bug report either through the extension, or as a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/leaningtech/cheerpj-appletrunner/issues).

## Is the CheerpJ Applet Runner free?

The CheerpJ Applet Runner can be used freely with no restriction on any publicly available, free Java applet.
